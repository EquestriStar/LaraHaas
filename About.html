    <p>I began my reale estate career in 2011, and have a genuine passion for assisting people in
navigating the highly important and complicated process of home buying. <br><br>
My philosophy is simple; clients come first. I understand the importance of listening closely
to the needs and goals of each client, as well as staying in constant communication and keeping
them fully informed throughout the entire real estate process. I believe that if you’re not left with
an amazing experience, I haven’t done my job. I don’t measure success through achievements
or awards, but through the satisfaction of my clients. <br><br>
I am an Idaho native who has lived in the Boise area for over 20 years, and have always valued the Idaho
lifestyle. I work to combine my deep knowledge of the area with the most up-to-date real estate
research int order to give my clients the best home search experience and market data. I balance
aggressive strategies, market knowledge and negotiating expertise, with a high level of integrity to
satisfy each and every client. <br> <br>
After earning a degree from Northern Arizona University, I moved back
to the Boise area where I raised my two children. During that time, I have enjoyed volunteering for various
organizations including The Boys and Girls Club, Idaho Dressage and Eventing Association, and
serving as an ambassador for the Eagle City Chamber of Commerce. When I am not working or volunteering,
I'm gardening – I'm a certified master gardener! My family and I take every opportunity to enjoy the
beautiful Idaho landscape, and I hope you will enjoy it as much as we do.</p>
